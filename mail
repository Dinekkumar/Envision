I am Dinek Kumar from Presidio, currently working on the cloud migration project for the Chartmover group. As part of the migration process, I need to collect some server information from the Chartmover server.

Could you please provide the necessary user credentials to access the server? If needed, should I create a ServiceNow ticket for formal approval of the user access?
